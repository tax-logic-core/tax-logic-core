## Overview

**tax-logic-core** is a community-auditable, open-source JavaScript library for US federal and state tax calculations. Every calculation and optimization includes IRS citations for transparency and accuracy.

### Why Open Source?

Tax logic should be **transparent** and **auditable**. By open-sourcing the core calculations:
- 🔍 Anyone can audit the math
- 🐛 Community can find and fix bugs
- 📚 IRS citations provide legal backing
- 🤝 Contributions improve accuracy for everyone

## Installation

```bash
npm install tax-logic-core
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
import { calculateTotalTax, analyzeTaxOptimizations } from 'tax-logic-core';

// Calculate taxes
const form = {
  filingStatus: 'married',
  totalWages: 150000,
  taxableInterest: 5000,
  // ... other form fields
};

const result = calculateTotalTax(form);
console.log(`Total Tax: $${result.finalTax}`);

// Find optimizations
const optimizations = analyzeTaxOptimizations(form);
console.log(`Potential Savings: $${optimizations.totalPotentialSavings}`);
```

## 2025 Tax Law Updates (OBBBA)

This library includes updates for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025:

- ✅ TCJA rates made permanent
- ✅ SALT cap increased to $40,000
- ✅ Section 179 limit raised to $2.5M
- ✅ 100% bonus depreciation restored
- ✅ Child Tax Credit increased to $2,200
- ✅ New deductions: Tips ($25k), Overtime ($12.5k), Auto Loan ($10k)

### Policy Flags

In some environments you may want to evaluate returns under pre‑OBBBA assumptions (e.g., SALT cap $10k, no new 2025 deductions). Use the policy flag on the form:

```js
// OBBBA-enabled (default behavior)
calculateTotalTax({ /* form fields... */, useObbba2025: true })

// Current-law fallback (pre‑OBBBA): SALT cap $10k, no new 2025 deductions
calculateTotalTax({ /* form fields... */, useObbba2025: false })
```

Other notable behaviors:

- Self-Employment tax considers W‑2 wages for the Social Security wage base and applies Additional Medicare thresholds by filing status: `calculateSelfEmploymentTax(income, wages=0, filingStatus='single')`.
- Capital losses are limited to $3,000 ($1,500 MFS) against ordinary income; excess carries forward (not modeled here).
- QBI limit subtracts qualified dividends and net long‑term gains. Optional K‑1 ordinary income minus guaranteed payments is included when provided.

## Testing

This repo uses Vitest. Run tests locally with:

```bash
npm test
```

If you encounter worker/thread issues in constrained environments, try one of:

```bash
vitest --run --pool=forks
vitest --run --threads=false
```

Core areas covered by unit tests include:

- Progressive bracket tax and LTCG stacking
- Self‑employment tax with W‑2 wages + thresholds
- Medical 7.5% floor and SALT cap policy gating
- Capital loss $3k ($1.5k MFS) limitation
- QBI limit with qualified dividends and LT gains; optional K‑1 inclusion
